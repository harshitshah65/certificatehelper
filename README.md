Certification Helper
Purpose:
This code is a Flask web application that generates a multiple-choice certification quiz for the AWS Solutions Architect certification. The quiz questions are generated using the Amazon Bedrock service, which provides access to various foundation models (FMs) for building generative AI applications.

Functionality:
1.	The code sets up the default AWS session region to "us-west-2" and creates two Boto3 clients: `bedrock_agent` and `bedrock_runtime`.
2.	The `agent_alias_id` variable is set to a specific agent alias ID, which is used to identify the agent that will generate the quiz questions.
3.	The code creates a JSON request body with a prompt to generate a set of 10 questions for the AWS Solutions Architect certification, and a maximum token limit of 1000.
4.	The `bedrock_runtime.invoke_model()` function is called to generate the quiz questions using the Anthropic Claude-v2 foundation model.
5.	The response from the Bedrock service is parsed to extract the JSON-formatted quiz questions, which are then stored in the `questions` variable.
6.	The Flask application is created with the `template_folder` set to "template".
7.	The `index()` function is defined as the route handler for the root URL ("/"). This function handles both GET and POST requests.
8.	In the GET request, the function renders the "index.html" template, passing the `questions` variable to it.
9.	In the POST request, the function checks the user's answers, calculates the score, and renders the "result.html" template with the score and total number of questions.
10.	The code includes a conditional block that formats the "options" and "answers" keys in the `question` dictionary to include numbered labels for the options.
11.	The application is run in debug mode when the script is executed directly.

Usage:
To use this application, you'll need to have the following prerequisites:
•	Python and Flask installed.
•	AWS credentials configured with the appropriate permissions to use the Amazon Bedrock service.
•	A valid agent alias ID for the Bedrock service
Once you have these prerequisites, you can run the application by executing the script. The application will be available at http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.
